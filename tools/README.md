# FFT Calculator

This package implements a simple GUI to calculate real positive Fourier transforms from data stored in a ´.csv´ file. It is aimed to be an educational resource for the structural dynamics course at the [Barcelona School of Civil Engineering](https://camins.upc.edu/en).

## Installation

**Option A** Copy the file `fft.py` into a place of your choice and make sure all the dependencies are installed.
```sh
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pyqt5 superqt
```
Then, execute the python script:
```sh
python owl-fft
```

**Option B** Install the wheels:
