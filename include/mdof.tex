\section{Vibration of MDOF structures}


\example{17}
A three storey building has the mass and stiffness distribution shown.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Approximate the first period of vibration using a linearly increasing mode.
    \item Using a linearly increasing mode together with a second Ritz vector increasing quadratically with height, approximate the first two modes and frequencies of vibration.
\end{enumerate}
