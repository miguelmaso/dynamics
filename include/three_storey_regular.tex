\begin{Exercise}[label=three_storey_regular]
A perfectly regular three storey building has a total weight of \SI{800}{kN} per floor. Each floor has an equal height of \SI{3}{m} and an inter-storey stiffness of \SI{20000}{kN/m}. Using a simplified shear building model with a single mode of vibration linearly increasing with height determine:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The main period of vibration.
    \item The total base shear according to the inelsatic Eurocode 8 earthquake design spectrum.
    \item The equivalent static loads at each floor for the same spectrum.
    \item The peak displecment at the top if the above spectrum corresponds to a behavioural factor $q=4$.
\end{enumerate}
