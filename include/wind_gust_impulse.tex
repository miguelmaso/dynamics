\begin{Exercise}[label={wind_gust_impulse}]
The building in Exercise \ref{helicopter_impulse} is hit by a sharp wind gust that results in the sudden application of horizontal forces distributed along the height of the building, as shown in the picture. Assuming a vibration shape function that increases linearly with the height and neglecting damping, determine the maximum displacement at the top of the building.

\begin{Answer}[ref={wind_gust_impulse}]
Now, the building in Exercise \ref{helicopter_impulse} is exposed to a sharp wind gust. In this case, the dynamics of the structure is defined by a \emph{mass-spring-damper} system under a constant force applied suddenly. The maximum amplitude is governed by the stationary or homogeneous solution to the differential equation
\begin{align*}
m\ddot{u} + c + ku = F_0 \\
u(t) = \frac{F_0}{k}(1 -e^{\xi\omega t}\cos(\omega t))\ .
\end{align*}

First, we need to determine the equivalent lateral force using the Rayleigh method from the wind pressure $p_W$, using the same shape function $\psi$ as in Exercise \ref{helicopter_impulse}:
\begin{align*}
F_0 = \int_0^h p_W\psi dz = \int_0^h \left(0.3 + (1-0.3)\frac{z}{h}\right)\frac{z}{h}dz = \left(\frac{0.3}{2} + \frac{0.7}{3}\right)h = \\
= \left(\frac{0.3}{2} + \frac{0.7}{3}\right)100 = \SI{38.3}{kN}\ .
\end{align*}

Following the Rayleigh method and the linear shape function $\psi$, the modal mass is found to be \SI{2e6}{kg}. The stiffness of the building can be estimated from the equivalent mass and the given period of the building
$$
k = \omega^2m = \left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2m = \left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right)^2 \num{2e6} = \SI{3.125e6}{N/m} = \SI{3125}{kN/m}
$$

Finally, the maximum displacement is obtained from the equation of motion
$$
u_{max} = \frac{F_0}{k}(1+1) = \frac{38.3}{3125}2 = \SI{0.025}{m} = \SI{2.5}{cm}\ .
$$
\end{Answer}
