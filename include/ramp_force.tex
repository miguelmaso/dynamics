\begin{Exercise}[label=ramp_force]
A load is applied on a structure in such a way that its magnitude increases linearly with time until a maximum value P is reached at time $t_0$. Determine the dynamic magnification factor as a function of $t_0$ and the natural period of vibration $T$ of the structure.
