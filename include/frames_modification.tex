\begin{Answer}[ref={frames_modification}]
Given that the natural period of vibration of the frame is $T=0.9$ seconds, the frequency is computed as
$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = \frac{2\pi}{0.9} = 6.98rad/s
$$
Then, the lateral stiffness is computed from the frequency and the mass of the structure,
$$
\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} \quad \rightarrow \quad
k = \omega^2m = \omega^2\frac{P}{g} = 6.98^2\frac{100}{10} = 487KN/m
$$

The goal of the second step is to determine the diameter of the steel cross-braces required to strengthen the structure by reducing the period to 0.3 seconds. First of all, the new stiffness is obtained following the same procedure,
\begin{align*}
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = \frac{2\pi}{0.3} = 20.94rad/s \\
k = \omega^2\frac{P}{g} = 20.94^2\frac{100}{10} = 4384KN/m
\end{align*}
The bracing system should provide the additional stiffness,
$$
k = k_{frame} + k_{bracing} \quad \rightarrow \quad k_{bracing} = 4384 - 487 = 3897KN/m
$$

We will consider the stiffness of one brace because the one under compression can buckle. 
Following the solution of example 1 (c), the area can be obtained from
\begin{align*}
k_{brace} &= \frac{EA}{l}\cos^2\theta \quad \rightarrow \quad A = \frac{k_{brace}l}{E\cos^2\theta} \\
l &= \sqrt{4^2 + 5^2} = 6.4m \\
\cos\theta &= \frac{5}{6.4} = 0.78 \\
A &= \frac{3897\cdot 6.4}{2\cdot 10^8\cdot 0.78} = 1.6\cdot 10^{-4} m^2 = 1.6cm^2
\end{align*}
and the diameter is obtained from the area,
$$
D = 2\sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{1.6}{\pi}} = 1.4cm
$$

The last part of the example consists on computing the new period of vibration if a further load of $50KN$ is added to the strengthened structure. Using the new lateral stiffness, the frequency is
$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{4384}{15}} = 17.1 rad/s
$$
and the new period is
$$
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{17.1} = 0.37s
$$
