\begin{Answer}[ref={frames_modification}]
Given that the natural period of vibration of the frame is \SI{0.9}{s}, the frequency is computed as
$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = \frac{2\pi}{0.9} = \SI{6.98}{rad/s}
$$
Then, the lateral stiffness is computed from the frequency and the mass of the structure,
$$
\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} \quad \rightarrow \quad
k = \omega^2m = \omega^2\frac{P}{g} = 6.98^2\frac{100}{10} = \SI{487}{kN/m}
$$

The goal of the second step is to determine the diameter of the steel cross-braces required to strengthen the structure by reducing the period to \SI{0.3}{s}. First, the new stiffness is obtained following the same procedure,
\begin{align*}
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = \frac{2\pi}{0.3} = \SI{20.94}{rad/s} \\
k = \omega^2\frac{P}{g} = 20.94^2\frac{100}{10} = \SI{4384}{kN/m}
\end{align*}
The bracing system should provide the additional stiffness,
$$
k = k_{frame} + k_{bracing} \quad \rightarrow \quad k_{bracing} = 4384 - 487 = \SI{3897}{kN/m}
$$

We will consider the stiffness of one brace because the one under compression can buckle. 
Following the solution of Exercise \ref{frames_frequency} (c), the area can be obtained from
\begin{align*}
k_{brace} &= \frac{EA}{l}\cos^2\theta \quad \rightarrow \quad A = \frac{k_{brace}l}{E\cos^2\theta} \\
l &= \sqrt{4^2 + 5^2} = \SI{6.4}{m} \\
\cos\theta &= \frac{5}{6.4} = 0.78 \\
A &\approx 2\cdot 10^{-4} m^2 = \SI{2}{cm^2}
\end{align*}
and the diameter is obtained from the area,
$$
D = 2\sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \approx \SI{1.6}{cm}
$$

The last part of the example consists in computing the new period of vibration if a further load of \SI{50}{kN} is added to the strengthened structure. Using the new lateral stiffness, the frequency is
$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{4384}{15}} \approx \SI{17.1}{rad/s}
$$
and the new period is
$$
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{17.1} \approx \SI{0.37}{s}
$$
