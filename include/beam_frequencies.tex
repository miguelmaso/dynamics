Analyitical expressions for the frequencies of vibration for beams can be found by means of the Rayleigh's method. Generally, sinusoidal functions are used, since the appropriate combination of them allow to consider multiple boundary conditions and the main modes of vibration.
The expressions shown in the table below coincide with the expressions proposed in most of the codes and application guidelines, see for instance \cite{sci-p354}. All of them are the result of applying the Raileigh's method with appropriate shape functions.

        Model & $f$ (Hz) & $M_\Psi$ \\ \hline
        simply supp  & $\displaystyle \frac{\pi}{2}\sqrt{\frac{EI}{L^3m}}$ & $\frac{m}{2}$ \\
        cantilever   & $\displaystyle \frac{\pi}{8\sqrt{3-8/\pi}}\sqrt{\frac{EI}{L^3m}}$ & $0.64m$ \\
