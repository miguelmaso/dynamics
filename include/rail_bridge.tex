\begin{Exercise}[label=rail_bridge]
A \SI{12}{m} long rail bridge has the continuous beam configuration shown in the figure, an average flexural stiffness $EI=\SI{5}{GN.m^2}$, a mass per unit length of \SI{10000}{kg/m} and a damping ratio of \SI{2}{\%}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Using Ratleigh's method with an appropriate sinusoidal function, obtain its fundamental frequency of vibration.
    \item Determine the equivalent modal force that results from the motion of a train consisting of an `infinite' number of \SI{100}{kN} point loads separated by equal distances of \SI{12}{m} and travelling at a constant speed of \SI{225}{km/h}.
    \item Obtain the dynamic magnification factor for the above train of loads.
\end{enumerate}
