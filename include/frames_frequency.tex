\begin{Answer}[ref={frames_frequency}]
The natural frequency of a structure is obtained from the solution of the differential equation governing the displacement of a \emph{mass spring} system without excitation:
$$
m\ddot{u}+ku=0
$$
where $m$ is the mass of the idealized system and $k$ is the stiffness. The natural frequency depends on both constants, $\omega^2 = k/m$.

Every single structure can be broken down into its elements and each element can be analysed by any of the standard methods. Here, to obtain the stiffness of each element, we impose a unit displacement $u_0$ generated by the corresponding force $F_0$. The stiffness of the structure is the sum of the stiffness of its components.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \pic {frame3PinnedSol};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \pic {columnPinned};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The displacement of the columns can be analysed as a cantilever using static analysis concepts:
$$
u_0 = \frac{F_0h^3}{3EI} \quad \rightarrow \quad k_{column} = \frac{3EI}{h^3}.
$$
Finally, the stiffness and the frequency of the structure are
$$
k = 3k_{column} = \frac{9EI}{h^3} \quad , \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac{9EI}{mh^3}}.
$$

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \pic {frameSol};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \pic {columnFixed};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Analogously, the second structure can be analysed by combining the stiffness of the columns. In this case, the rotation $\varphi_0 = u_0/h$ generated by the moment reaction $M_0$ has been imposed on the equivalent beams. The moment reaction must satisfy global equilibrium:
$$
\sum M = 2M_0 -F_0h = 0.
$$
From static analysis, the rotation generated by the moment is
$$
\varphi_0 = \frac{M_0h}{6EI}
$$
Substituting the moment and the rotation into the above expression gives
$$
\frac{u_0}{h} = \frac{F_0h}{12EI} \quad \rightarrow \quad k_{column} = \frac{12EI}{h^3}.
$$
The lateral stiffness and frequency of the structure are
$$
k = 2k_{column} = \frac{24EI}{h^3} \quad , \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac{24EI}{mh^3}}.
$$

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \pic {frameBracingSol};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \pic {bracing};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The last structure adds two braces, and its stiffness will be added, but only one of them is contributing, because the bracing buckles under compression. The stiffness of a brace is
$$
\delta = \frac{Pl}{EA} \quad \rightarrow \quad k_{brace} = \frac{EA}{l}\cos^2\theta
$$
and the lateral stiffness and frequency of the structure are
$$
k = 2k_{column} + k_{brace} = \frac{24EI}{h^3}+\frac{EA}{l}\cos^2\theta \quad , \quad 
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{24EI}{mh^3}+\frac{EA}{ml}\cos^2\theta}.
$$
