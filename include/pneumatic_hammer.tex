\begin{Exercise}[label=pneumatic_hammer]
A pneumatic hammer is to be used on a simply supported square concrete plate measuring $12\times\SI{12}{m^2}$ at a point \SI{2}{m} away from each side. The hammer operates at \SI{2}{Hz} and each blow corresponds to an instantaneous impulse of \SI{100}{N.s}. The plate has a natural frequency of vibration of \SI{8}{Hz}, a damping ratio of \SI{2}{\%} and a mass of \SI{500}{kg/m^2}.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Determine the equivalent static load.
    \item Obtain the deflection at the mid-span as a function of time, its peak value and the peack acceleration.
\end{enumerate}
