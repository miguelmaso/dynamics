\begin{Exercise}[label={two_storey_helicopter}]
The two storey building from the previous exercise is hit by a helicopter with a mass of $10\ Tn$ traveling at $20\ m/s$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Determine the resulting vibration and the maximum displacement at the top of the building using both modes of vibration.
    \item Determine the resulting vibration and the maximum displacement at the top on the assumption that the linearly increasing mode absorbs the total momentum.
\end{enumerate}
