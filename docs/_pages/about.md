Hi, I'm Miguel Mas√≥, PhD Civil Engineer

I am currently working at [SOCOTEC](https://www.socotec.es/en), Building and Cities department, and I am also Adjunct Lecturer of Structural Dynamics at the [Barcelona School of Civil Engineering](https://camins.upc.edu/en). Passionate about research and open source projects. I've been resaearcher at [CIMNE](https://www.cimne.com/) during five years, while developing my thesis in computational mechanics, focused in the shallow water equations, stabilization of hyperbolic equations and coupling with the Navier-Stokes equations.
