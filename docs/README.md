This page contains a collection of examples for the structural dynamics course.
It aims to illustrate the theoretical concepts of structural dynamics and to connect the theory lessons with the laboratory activities.
Following this double scope, the examples are classified in two parts, a static LaTeX document and an extension of Jupyter notebooks.

## Notebooks

### Free vibrations

The first laboratory activity consists on the identification of dynamic properties of a single degree of freedom structure.
Extending the solution of Example 4, two notebooks help identifying the dynamic properties.
The first notebook uses simple theoretical concepts. The second one, makes the identification through signal analysis.

### Forced vibrations

In this section, three notebooks introduce the basic concepts of the third laboratory.
Following Example 5, a frequency sweep is presented to generate the dynamic response factor of a single degree of freedom structure.
The response of a structure is analyzed in more detail in another notebook using Fourier series' to decompose the forcing signal.
Finally, another notebook shows how to integrate the response of a structure using the Duhamel or Newmark methods.

### Multiple degree of freedom

The course ends with a laboratory devoted to a multiple degree of freedom structure and to seismic actions.
Two notebooks provide useful tools for the laboratory, a modal decomposition and the generation of the response spectrum of a seismic signal.
