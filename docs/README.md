This page contains a collection of examples for the structural dynamics course.
It aims to illustrate the theoretical concepts of structural dynamics and to connect the theory lessons with the laboratory activities.
Following this double scope, the examples are classified in two parts, a static LaTeX document and an extension of Jupyter notebooks.
