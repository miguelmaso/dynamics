\newpage
\section{Solutions}


\example{1}
The natural frequency of a structure is obtained from the solution of the differential equation governing the displacement of a \emph{spring mass} system without excitation.
$$
m\ddot{u}+ku=0
$$
where $m$ is the mass of the idealized system and $k$ is the stiffness. The natural frequency depends on both constants, $\omega^2 = k/m$.

Every single structure can be decomposed in its elements and each element, analyzed by any of the standard methods. Here, to obtain the stiffness of each element, we impose a unit displacement $u_0$ generated by the corresponding force $F_0$. The stiffness of the structure is the sum of the stiffness of its components.

\begin{center}
    \pictures{portic3pinned_sol}
    \pictures{columnpinned}
\end{center}

The displacement of the columns can be analyzed as a cantilever using static analysis concepts:
$$
u_0 = \frac{F_0h^3}{3EI} \quad \rightarrow \quad k_{column} = \frac{3EI}{h^3}
$$
Finally, the stiffness and the frequency of the structure are
$$
k = 3k_{column} = \frac{9EI}{h^3} \quad , \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac{9EI}{mh^3}}
$$

\begin{center}
    \pictures{portic_sol}
    \pictures{columnfixed}
\end{center}

Analogously, the second structure can be analyzed combining the stiffness of the columns. In that case, rotation $\varphi_0 = u_0/h$ generated by the moment reaction $M_0$ has been imposed to the equivalent beams. The moment reaction must satisfy global equilibrium:
$$
\sum M = 2M_0 -F_0h = 0
$$
And from static analysis, the rotation generated by the moment is
$$
\varphi_0 = \frac{M_0h}{6EI}
$$
Substituting the moment and the rotation into the above expression gives
$$
\frac{u_0}{h} = \frac{F_0h}{12EI} \quad \rightarrow \quad k_{column} = \frac{12EI}{h^3}
$$
The lateral stiffness and frequency of the structure are
$$
k = 2k_{column} = \frac{24EI}{h^3} \quad , \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac{24EI}{mh^3}}
$$

\begin{center}
    \pictures{porticbracing_sol}
    \pictures{bracing}
\end{center}

The last structure adds two braces and its stiffness shall be added, but only one of them is contributing, since the bracing under compression buckles. The stiffness of a brace is
$$
\delta = \frac{Pl}{EA} \quad \rightarrow \quad k_{brace} = \frac{EA}{l}\cos^2\theta
$$
and the lateral stiffness and frequency of the structure are
$$
k = 2k_{column} + k_{brace} = \frac{24EI}{h^3}+\frac{EA}{l}\cos^2\theta \quad , \quad 
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{24EI}{mh^3}+\frac{EA}{ml}\cos^2\theta}
$$



\example{2}
The Rayleigh's method is based on assuming the vibration to be given in terms of a pre-determined shape function $\psi$ as $u(x,t) = u_0(t)\psi(x)$. This assumption allows to find an equivalent mass and stiffness associated to that mode of vibration and thus, the frequency.

\parbox{.7\textwidth}{For the simple beam, a possible shape function would be a parabola satisfying the kynematic boundary conditions, $\psi(0) = \psi(l) = 0$.} \hspace{1em}
\parbox{.25\textwidth}{\pictures{simplebeam}}
\begin{align*}
&\psi(x) = \frac{4}{l^2} x (l-x) \\
&\psi''(x) = \frac{8}{l^2}
\end{align*}
where the term $4/l^2$ is a scaling parameter and does not modify the solution. The equivalent mass and stiffness and frequency are
\begin{align*}
&m = \int_0^l \rho A\psi^2dx = \int_0^l \rho A \left(\frac{4}{l^2} x (l-x)\right)^2dx = \frac{8\rho Al}{15} \\
&k = \int_0^l EI \psi''^2 dx = \int_0^l EI \left(\frac{8}{l^2}\right)^2dx = \frac{64EI}{l^3} \\
&\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{64EI}{l^3}\frac{15}{8\rho Al}} = \frac{1}{l^2}\sqrt{120\frac{EI}{\rho A}} \approx 10.95\frac{1}{l^2}\sqrt{\frac{EI}{\rho A}} rad/s
\end{align*}
The obtained result can be compared against the exact frequency, obtained by the same procedure applied to a fourth order polynomial satisfying both kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions. The analytical result is $\omega = \frac{1}{l^2}\sqrt{\frac{3024EI}{31\rho A}} \approx 9.86\frac{1}{l^2}\sqrt{\frac{EI}{\rho A}} rad/s$.

\parbox{.7\textwidth}{The cantilever can be analyzed using a second order polynomial. In that case, the kinematic boundary conditions are $\psi(0) = \psi'(0) = 0$.} \hspace{1em}
\parbox{.25\textwidth}{\pictures{cantilever}}
\begin{align*}
&\psi(x) = \frac{1}{l^2} x^2 \\
&\psi''(x) = \frac{2}{l^2}
\end{align*}
Again, the term $1/l^2$ is a scaling term providing consistency and does not modify the result of the calculations.
\begin{align*}
&m = \int_0^l \rho A\psi^2dx = \int_0^l \rho A \left(\frac{1}{l^2} x^2\right)^2dx = \frac{\rho Al}{5} \\
&k = \int_0^l EI \psi''^2 dx = \int_0^l EI \left(\frac{2}{l^2}\right)^2dx = \frac{4EI}{l^3} \\
&\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{4EI}{l^3}\frac{5}{\rho Al}} = \frac{1}{l^2}\sqrt{20\frac{EI}{\rho A}} \approx 4.47\frac{1}{l^2}\sqrt{\frac{EI}{\rho A}} rad/s
\end{align*}
On the other hand, the exact frequency of the first mode of vibration of a cantilever is $\omega\approx3.52\frac{1}{l^2}\sqrt{\frac{EI}{\rho A}}rad/s$.

The last two structures can be analyzed using a cubic polynomial, since the shape function must fulfill three kinematic boundary conditions.

For the application of Rayleigh's method with periodic shape functions, see the solution to example 9.



\example{3}
Given that the natural period of vibration of the frame is $T=0.9$ seconds, the frequency is computed as
$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = \frac{2\pi}{0.9} = 6.98rad/s
$$
Then, the lateral stiffness is computed from the frequency and the mass of the structure,
$$
\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m} \quad \rightarrow \quad
k = \omega^2m = \omega^2\frac{P}{g} = 6.98^2\frac{100}{10} = 487KN/m
$$

The goal of the second step is to determine the diameter of the steel cross-braces required to strengthen the structure by reducing the period to 0.3 seconds. First of all, the new stiffness is obtained following the same procedure,
\begin{align*}
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = \frac{2\pi}{0.3} = 20.94rad/s \\
k = \omega^2\frac{P}{g} = 20.94^2\frac{100}{10} = 4384KN/m
\end{align*}
The bracing system should provide the additional stiffness,
$$
k = k_{frame} + k_{bracing} \quad \rightarrow \quad k_{bracing} = 4384 - 487 = 3897KN/m
$$

We will consider the stiffness of one brace because the one under compression can buckle. 
Following the solution of example 1 (c), the area can be obtained from
\begin{align*}
k_{brace} &= \frac{EA}{l}\cos^2\theta \quad \rightarrow \quad A = \frac{k_{brace}l}{E\cos^2\theta} \\
l &= \sqrt{4^2 + 5^2} = 6.4m \\
\cos\theta &= \frac{5}{6.4} = 0.78 \\
A &= \frac{3897\cdot 6.4}{2\cdot 10^8\cdot 0.78} = 1.6\cdot 10^{-4} m^2 = 1.6cm^2
\end{align*}
and the diameter is obtained from the area,
$$
D = 2\sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} = 2\sqrt{\frac{1.6}{\pi}} = 1.4cm
$$

The last part of the example consists on computing the new period of vibration if a further load of $50KN$ is added to the strengthened structure. Using the new lateral stiffness, the frequency is
$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{4384}{15}} = 17.1 rad/s
$$
and the new period is
$$
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{17.1} = 0.37s
$$



\example{4}
The solution to the differential equation governing free vibration of a \emph{mass spring damper} system is governed by the natural and damped frequencies and the damping ratio:
$$
u(t) = e^{-\xi\omega t}\sin(\omega_D t) \quad ; \quad \omega_D = \omega\sqrt{1-\xi^2}
$$
For simplicity, we will assume a small damping and $\sqrt{1-\xi^2}\rightarrow1$, thus, the natural period can be obtained directly from the measured values
$$
T \approx T_D = \frac{3}{20} = 0.15s
$$
And the damping ratio $\xi$ is directly related to the decay coefficient determined by the relation among two consecutive oscillations from a damped period
$$
\frac{u(t)}{u(t+T_D)} = e^{\xi\omega T_D} = e^{\frac{2\pi\xi}{\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}} \quad \rightarrow \quad
\frac{u_0}{u_1} \frac{u_1}{u_2} \dots \frac{u_{n-1}}{u_n} = \frac{u_0}{u_n} = e^{\frac{2n\pi\xi}{\sqrt{1-\xi^2}}}
$$
Since $\xi$ is small, the damping ratio can be found as
\begin{align*}
2n\pi\xi = \log\left(\frac{u_0}{u_n}\right) \quad \rightarrow \quad
\xi = \frac{1}{2n\pi} \log\left(\frac{u_0}{u_n}\right) = \frac{1}{2\cdot20\pi} \log\left(\frac{5}{1}\right) = 0.0128 \\
\xi = 1.28\%
\end{align*}



\example{5}
The maximum displacements and accelerations of a vibrating structure under sinusoidal excitation are obtained from the stationary or homogeneous solution to the differential equation,
\begin{align*}
m\ddot{u} + ku = F_0\sin(\Omega t + \varphi) \\
u(t) = \frac{F_0}{k}H\sin(\Omega t + \varphi - \Delta\varphi)
\end{align*}

where $H$ is known as the magnification factor and is equal to
$$
H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1-\gamma^2)^2 + 4\xi^2\gamma^2}} \quad ; \quad
\gamma = \frac{\Omega}{\omega} = \frac{T_{struct}}{T_{force}}
$$

From the solution to example 3 (a) we know that the period is $T=0.9$ seconds and the frequency is $\omega = 2\pi/T \approx 7rad/s$ and the lateral stiffness is $k=487KN/m$. The damping ratio is $\xi=5\%$.

The amplitude $F_0$ of the external force is computed from the amplitude of the ground acceleration and the moving mass of the structure
$$
F_0 = ma_{0} = \frac{Pa_0}{g} = \frac{100\cdot2}{10} = 20KN
$$

Finally, the maximum displacements will depend on the period $\Omega$ of the external force,
\begin{align*}
&u_0 = \frac{F_0}{k}H = \frac{20}{487}H = 0.041H\ m = 4.1H\ cm \\
&\ddot{u}_0 = \frac{F_0}{m}\gamma^2H = \Omega^2u_0
\end{align*}


When the period of the ground acceleration is $T_g=0.15s$, the maximum displacements and accelerations are
\begin{align*}
&\gamma = \frac{0.9}{0.15} = 9 \quad ; \quad
H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1-9^2)^2 + 4\cdot 0.05^2\cdot 9^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{80^4 + \cdots}} = 0.00015 \\
&u_0 = 4.1\cdot 0.00015 = 0.00064 cm \\
&\ddot{u}_0 = \left(\frac{2\pi}{0.15}\right)^2 \cdot 0.00064 = 1.1cm\,s^{-2} = 0.011m\,s^{-2}
\end{align*}
This situation is \emph{mass dominated}, also known as \emph{vibration isolation}.

When the period of the ground acceleration is $T_g=0.9s$, the maximum values are
\begin{align*}
&\gamma = \frac{0.9}{0.9} = 1 \quad ; \quad
H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1-1^2)^2 + 4\cdot 0.05^2\cdot 1^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0 + 4\cdot 0.05^2}} = 10 \\
&u_0 = 4.1\cdot 10 = 41 cm \\
&\ddot{u}_0 = \left(\frac{2\pi}{0.9}\right)^2 \cdot 41 = 2000cm\,s^{-2} = 20m\,s^{-2}
\end{align*}
The \emph{resonance} situation is \emph{damping dominated}.

And for a period $T_g=5s$, the maximum values are
\begin{align*}
&\gamma = \frac{0.9}{5} = 0.18 \quad ; \quad
H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1-0.18^2)^2 + 4\cdot 0.05^2\cdot 0.18^2}} = 1.033 \\
&u_0 = 4.1\cdot 1.033 = 4.2 cm \\
&\ddot{u}_0 = \left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right)^2 \cdot 4.2 = 6.6cm\,s^{-2} = 0.066m\,s^{-2}
\end{align*}
Which is a practically \emph{static} situation or \emph{stiffness dominated}.

\example{6}
When the building is hit by the helicopter, the impulse or linear momentum is preserved. To compute the linear momentum of the building, we need to know the equivalent mass and we can use the Rayleigh's method for that purpose. As it is suggested, we will use a linear shape function
\begin{align*}
&u = u_0\psi \quad ; \quad \psi = \frac{z}{h} \\
&m = \int_0^h \rho A\psi^2dz = \rho A\int_0^h\frac{z^2}{h^2}dz = \frac{1}{3}\rho Ah = \frac{1}{3} 1500 \cdot 400 \cdot 100 = \\
& \pushright{= 2\cdot 10^7N = 2\cdot 10^6Kg}
\end{align*}

The impulse of the helicopter is
$$
I = (mv)_{helicopter} = 10^4 \cdot 30 = 3\cdot 10^5 Kg\,m\,s^-1
$$
which is transferred to the building. Then, the maximum deflection at the top of the building is inferred
\begin{align*}
&\dot{u}_0 = \frac{I}{m} \quad \rightarrow \quad u_0 = \frac{I}{m\omega} \\
&\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = \frac{2\pi}{5} = 1.25rad\,s^{-1} \\
&u_0 = \frac{3\cdot 10^5}{2\cdot 10^6\cdot 1.25} = 0.12m = 12cm
\end{align*}



\example{7}
Now, the building from example 6 is exposed to sudden wind gust. In that case dynamics of the  structure are defined by a \emph{mass spring damper} system under a constant force suddenly applied.The maximum amplitude is governed by the stationary or homogeneous solution to the differential equation
\begin{align*}
m\ddot{u} + c + ku = F_0 \\
u(t) = \frac{F_0}{k}(1 -e^{\xi\omega t}\cos(\omega t))
\end{align*}

First of all, we need to determine the equivalent lateral force using the Rayleigh's method from the wind pressure $p_W$, using the same shape function $\psi$ from example 6,
\begin{align*}
F_0 = \int_0^h p_W\psi dz = \int_0^h \left(0.3 + (1-0.3)\frac{z}{h}\right)\frac{z}{h}dz = \left(\frac{0.3}{2} + \frac{0.7}{3}\right)h = \\
= \left(\frac{0.3}{2} + \frac{0.7}{3}\right)100 = 38.3KN
\end{align*}

The stiffness of the building can be estimated from the equivalent mass and the given period of the building
$$
k = \omega^2m = \left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2m = \left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right)^2 2\cdot 10^6 = 3.125\cdot 10^6 N/m = 3125KN/m
$$

Finally, the maximum displacement is obtained from the equation of motion
$$
u_{max} = \frac{F_0}{k}(1+1) = \frac{38.3}{3125}2 = 0.025m = 2.5cm
$$



\example{8}
The motion of the mass released from a given height and attached to a cable has two parts. Firstly, a free fall. Secondly, a vibration. The velocity at the end of the free fall is
$$
\frac{1}{2}m\dot{u}_0^2 = mgl \quad \rightarrow \quad \dot{u}_0 = \sqrt{gl}
$$

And the vibration is described by a sudden force suddenly applied; the external force $F_0$ is generated by the gravity weight $mg$ and the stresses in the cable are obtained from elastic analysis. The same equations of example 7 can be applied here. Neglecting damping,
$$
u(t) = \frac{F_0}{k}(1 -\cos(\omega t))
$$

And the maximum displacement $u$ and stress $\sigma$ are
\begin{align*}
&u_{max} = \frac{F_0}{k}2 = 2\frac{mg}{EA} \\
&\sigma_{max} = E\varepsilon_{max} = E\frac{u_{max}}{l} = 2\frac{mg}{Al}
\end{align*}



\example{9}
In that case, the magnitude of the external force $P=1KN$ is not varying with time, but moving with constant speed $v=10m/s$. The Rayleigh's method allow us to compute the equivalent force applied as a function of time. For that purpose, we choose a periodic shape function $\psi$ satisfying the kinematic boundary conditions
\begin{align*}
&\psi = \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{l}\right) \\
&F = P\psi(x) = P\psi(vt) = P\sin\left(\frac{\pi vt}{l}\right)
\end{align*}
thus, the equivalent period of the external excitation is $\Omega = \pi v/l = 1\,rad\cdot s^{-1}$.

The mechanical properties of the section are
\begin{align*}
&A = 0.5m^2 \\
&I = \frac{1}{12}0.5^3 = \frac{0.125}{12} \approx 0.01 m^4\\
&E = 14GPa
\end{align*}

Now, the equivalent mass and stiffness can be computed with the Rayleigh's method,
\begin{align*}
&m = \int_0^l \rho A\psi^2dx = \int_0^l \rho A\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi x}{l}\right)dx = \frac{\rho Al}{2} = \\
& \pushright{= \frac{2800 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 10\pi}{2} = 7000\pi Kg = 7\pi Tn} \\
&k = \int_0^l EI\psi''^2dx = \int_0^l EI\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{l}\right)^2\sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{l}\right)\right)^2dx = \frac{EI\pi^4}{2l^3} = \qquad \\
& \pushright{= \frac{14\cdot 10^6 \cdot 0.01 \cdot \pi^4}{2 \cdot (10\pi)^3} =
70\pi KN/m}
\end{align*}
and the frequency is
$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{70\pi}{7\pi}} = \sqrt{10} = 3.16\,rad\cdot s^{-1}
$$

Finally, the structural response is obtained following the same steps from example 5, a structure under periodic loading. The deflection depends on the dynamic magnification factor $H$ and assuming a small damping ratio,
\begin{align*}
&\gamma = \frac{\Omega}{\omega} = \frac{\pi v}{l\omega} \\
&H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\left(1-\frac{\pi^2v^2}{l^2\omega^2}\right)^2 + 4\xi^2\frac{\pi^2v^2}{l^2\omega^2}}} \approx \frac{1}{1-\frac{\pi^2v^2}{l^2\omega^2}} = \frac{l^2\omega^2}{l^2\omega^2-\pi^2v^2} = \qquad \\
&\pushright{= \frac{10^2\cdot\pi^2\cdot 3.16^2}{10^2\cdot\pi^2\cdot 3.16^2 - 10^2\cdot\pi^2}
= \frac{10}{10-1} = 1.11}
\end{align*}

Then, the deflection of the beam as a function of time is
$$
u = \frac{P}{k}H\sin(\Omega t) = \frac{1}{70\pi}1.11\sin(t) = 0.005\sin(t)\,m = 0.5\sin(t)\,cm
$$

And the maximum bending moment at the centre section is
$$
M_{max} = \frac{Pl}{4}H = \frac{1 \cdot 10\pi}{4}1.11 = 8.7\,KNm
$$
