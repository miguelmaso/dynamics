The portal frame structure shown has a weight of $100KN$. If the natural period of vibration is 0.9 seconds:

    \item determine the lateral stiffness of the structure;
    \item determine the diameter of the steel cross-braces required to strenghten the structure by reducing the period to 0.3 seconds;
    \item determine the period if a further load of $50KN$ is added to the strenghtened structure.

\example{4}
In order to determine the dynamic properties of a simply supported bridge witha mass of $10^6Kg$, the midpoint is displaced $5mm$ by a jack and then suddenly released. At the end of 20 complete cycles, the time is 3 seconds and the peack displacement measured is $1mm$. Determine the natural period and damping ratio of the bridge.

\section{Forced vibration of SDOF structures}


\example{5} The portal frame of example 3 (a) is subject to a sinusoidal ground vibration with horizontal acceleration amplitude of $2m/s^2$. Assuming a damping ratio of $5\%$, determine the maximum displacement and maximum total acceleration of the frame when the period of floor vibration is: 0.1 seconds; 0.9 seconds and 5 seconds.

\example{6} A building has a height of $100m$, a square base measuring $20\times20m^2$, an average specific weight of $1\,500N/m^3$ and a natural period of vibration of 5 seconds. The top floor is hit by an helicopter with a mass of $10\,000Kg$ and travelling at $30m/s$. Determine the maximum deflection at the top assuming conservation of linear momentum and a vibration shape function that increases linearly with the height.

\example{7} The building of example 6 is hit by a sudden wind gust which results in the sudden application of horizontal forces distributed along the height of the building as shown in the picture. Assuming a vibration shape fuction that increases linearly with the height and neglecting damping, determine the maximum displacement at the top of the building.

\example{8} A mass $m$ is released from a given height attached to a massless calbe of length $l$, area $A$ and Young's modulus $E$. If the cable is fixed at the point from which the mass is released, describe the motion/vibration of the mass. Determine the maximum stress in the cable and the lowest point reached by the mass.


\example{9} A point load $F=1KN$ moves along with constant speed $v=10m/s$ on a simply supported beam of length $l=1p\pi m$ as shown in the figure. The beam is made of concrete, has a rectanular section of $1m$ and an average density of $2\,800Kg/m^3$. Determine the deflection of the beam as function of time, the dynamic magnification factor and the maximum bending moment at the centre section.

\section{Solutions}


\example{1}
The natural frequency of a structure is obtained from the solution of the differential equation governing the displacement of a \emph{spring mass} system without excitation.
$$
m\ddot{u}+ku=0
$$
where $m$ is the mass of the idealized system and $k$ is the stiffness. The natural frequency depends on both constants, $\omega^2 = k/m$.

Every single structure can be decomposed in its elements and each element, analyzed by any of the standard methods. Here, to obtain the stiffness of each element, we impose a unit displacement $u_0$ generated by the corresponding force $F_0$. The stiffness of the structure is the sum of the stiffness of its components.

\begin{center}
    \pictures{portic3pinned_sol}
    \pictures{columnpinned}
\end{center}

The displacement of the columns can be analyized as a cantilever using static analysis concepts:
$$
u_0 = \frac{F_0h^3}{3EI} \quad \rightarrow \quad k_{column} = \frac{3EI}{h^3}
$$
Finally, the stiffness and the frqeuncy of the structure are
$$
k = 3k_{column} = \frac{9EI}{h^3} \quad , \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac{9EI}{mh^3}}
$$


\begin{center}
    \pictures{portic_sol}
    \pictures{columnfixed}
\end{center}

Analogously, the second structure can be analyzed combining the stiffness of the colunms. In that case, rotation $\varphi_0 = u_0/h$ generated by the moment reaction $M_0$ has been imposed to the quivalent beams. The moment reaction must satisfy global equilibrium:
$$
\sum M = 2M_0 -F_0h = 0
$$

And from static analysis, the rotation generated by the moment is
$$
\varphi_0 = \frac{M_0h}{6EI}
$$

Substituting the moment and the rotation into the above expression gives
$$
\frac{u_0}{h} = \frac{F_0h}{12EI} \quad \rightarrow \quad k_{column} = \frac{12EI}{h^3}
$$

The lateral stiffness and frequency of the structure are
$$
k = 2k_{column} = \frac{24EI}{h^3} \quad , \quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac{24EI}{mh^3}}
$$

\end{center}

The last structure adds two braces and its stiffness shall be added, but only one of them is contributing, since the bracing under compression buckles. The stifness of a brace is
$$
\delta = \frac{Pl}{EA} \quad \rightarrow \quad k_{brace} = \frac{EA}{l}\cos^2\theta
$$

and the lateral stiffness and frequency of the structure are
$$
k = 2k_{column} + k_{brace} = \frac{24EI}{h^3}+\frac{EA}{l}\cos^2\theta \quad , \quad 
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{24EI}{mh^3}+\frac{EA}{ml}\cos^2\theta}
$$

\example{3}

\example{4}
The damping ratio $\xi$ is directly related to the decay coefficient
$\zeta=2\pi\xi$ and $\zeta$ is determined by the ratio among two consecutive oscillations
$$
\frac{u_n}{u_{n+1}} = e^\zeta \quad \rightarrow \quad
\frac{u_0}{u_1} \frac{u_1}{u_2} \dots \frac{u_{n-1}}{u_n} = \frac{u_0}{u_n} = e^{n\zeta}
$$
According to this relation, the damping ratio can be found as
\begin{align*}
n\zeta = \log\left(\frac{u_0}{u_n}\right) \quad \rightarrow \quad
\xi = \frac{1}{2n\pi} \log\left(\frac{u_0}{u_n}\right) = \frac{1}{2\cdot20\pi} \log\left(\frac{5}{1}\right) = 0.0128 \\
\xi = 1.28\%
\end{align*}
