\example{3}
The portal frame structure shown has a weight of $100KN$. If the natural period of vibration is 0.9 seconds:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item determine the lateral stiffness of the structure;
    \item determine the diameter of the steel cross-braces required to strenghten the structure by reducing the period to 0.3 seconds;
    \item determine the period if a further load of $50KN$ is added to the strenghtened structure.
\end{enumerate}

\example{4}
In order to determine the dynamic properties of a simply supported bridge witha mass of $10^6Kg$, the midpoint is displaced $5mm$ by a jack and then suddenly released. At the end of 20 complete cycles, the time is 3 seconds and the peack displacement measured is $1mm$. Determine the natural period and damping ratio of the bridge.

\section{Forced vibration of SDOF structures}


\example{5} The portal frame of example 3 (a) is subject to a sinusoidal ground vibration with horizontal acceleration amplitude of $2m/s^2$. Assuming a damping ratio of $5\%$, determine the maximum displacement and maximum total acceleration of the frame when the period of floor vibration is: 0.1 seconds; 0.9 seconds and 5 seconds.

\example{6} A building has a height of $100m$, a square base measuring $20\times20m^2$, an average specific weight of $1\,500N/m^3$ and a natural period of vibration of 5 seconds. The top floor is hit by an helicopter with a mass of $10\,000Kg$ and travelling at $30m/s$. Determine the maximum deflection at the top assuming conservation of linear momentum and a vibration shape function that increases linearly with the height.

\example{7} The building of exercise 6 is hit by a sudden wind gust which results in the sudden application of horizontal forces distributed along the height of the building as shown in the picture. Assuming a vibration shape fuction that increases linearly with the height and neglecting damping, determine the maximum displacement at the top of the building.

\example{4}
The damping ratio $\xi$ is directly related to the decay coefficient
$\zeta=2\pi\xi$ and $\zeta$ is determined by the ratio among two consecutive oscillations
$$
\frac{u_n}{u_{n+1}} = e^\zeta \quad \rightarrow \quad
\frac{u_0}{u_1} \frac{u_1}{u_2} \dots \frac{u_{n-1}}{u_n} = \frac{u_0}{u_n} = e^{n\zeta}
$$
According to this relation, the damping ratio can be found as
\begin{align*}
n\zeta = \log\left(\frac{u_0}{u_n}\right) \quad \rightarrow \quad
\xi = \frac{1}{2n\pi} \log\left(\frac{u_0}{u_n}\right) = \frac{1}{2\cdot20\pi} \log\left(\frac{5}{1}\right) = 0.0128 \\
\xi = 1.28\%
\end{align*}
