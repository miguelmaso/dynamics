# Dynamics
A collection of examples for the structural dynamics course. The contents of this repo are classified into several parts:
- A static [LaTeX document](https://github.com/miguelmaso/dynamics/blob/gh-pages/problems.pdf) with academic examples
- An interactive extension of the examples with [Jupyter notebooks](ipython/README.md)
- A Python pacage for processing data recorded at the laboratory.

## LaTeX build
The document is to be compiled using pdflatex and biber, other compilers have not been tested. Run the following [commands](.github/workflows/build_pdf.sh) to compile the document:
```sh
pdflatex problems
biber    problems
pdflatex problems
pdflatex problems
```

### VS Code configuration
